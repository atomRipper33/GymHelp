Application that helps you manage memberships and track clients.<br>
Hi, I made this application few years ago for local gym.
<h2>Features:</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li> track when memberships for specific clients are ending</li>
  <li> track earnings accompanied with graphs (monthly, yearly)</li>
  <li> automatically send emails to clients whose membership is ending the next day ( you can set when excatly that is)</li>
  <li> export membership database, export earnings database</li>
  <li> import membership database, import earnings database</li>
  <li> owner is notified by notification when daily email is sent to clients with information how many memberships is ending today</li>
</ul>
<br>
It is worth saying that this application can be improved in many ways: file structure, retriving data from database(SQL lite), user friendy interface (so user can change
information without code) and much more.
<h4>I hope this repository can help someone in building their own application. Everyone is welcome to make it better.<br> Enjoy.</h4>
